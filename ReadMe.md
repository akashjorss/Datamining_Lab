Problem Statement:
A marketing analyst would like to figure out which customers he could expect to buy 
the new eReader and on what time schedule, based on the companyâ€™s last release of 
a high-profile digital reader. He would like to segment customers in order to provide 
them the appropriate advertising.
Knowing that there are four possible values of eReader_Adoption: 
[1]Innovator: purchase within the 1st week 
[2]Early Adopter: purchase within 2 or 3 weeks 
[3]Early Majority: purchase > 3weeks but <= 2 months 
[4]Late Majority: purchase after the first two month 
The criteria and suggestions for segmenting customers are as follows: 
[1] Those who are most likely to purchase immediately (predicted innovators) can be 
contacted and encouraged to go ahead and buy as soon as the new product comes out. 
They may even want the option to pre-order the new device.  On the other hand, 
perhaps very little marketing is needed to the predicted innovators, since they 
are predicted to be the most likely to buy the eReader in the first place. 
[2] Those who are probably likely to purchase earlier (often are opinion leaders, 
predicted early adopter) 
[3] Those who are less likely (predicted early majority) might need some persuasion, 
perhaps a free digital book or two with eReader purchase or a discount on digital music 
playable on the new eReader. 
[4] The least likely (predicted late majority), can be marketed to passively, or perhaps 
not at all if marketing budgets are tight and those dollars need to be spent incentivizing 
the most likely customers to buy.
